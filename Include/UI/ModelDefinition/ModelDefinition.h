//! The model class the handles the dispaying of objects

    This class is designed to handle the bulk of dispalying the geometry onto a glCanvas.
    This class will handle the drawing of any nodes/arcs/lines/labels. Along
    with any zooming, mouse moving, dragging, snapping to grid, and selecting geometry objects.
    Other functionality in the class include creating copies of selected geometry and moving selected geometry.
    THe modelDefinition inherits from the wxGLCanvas class because the modelDefinition class
    handles all direct calls for openGL.

        is for the frid. All of these are controlled by the user preference. For the grid preference, the function checks the variable
        _preferences in order to determine what should be drawn.
      
        Drawing the crosshair for the center point and drawing the axis is quite straight forward. Both function in a similiar manner.
        At the top of the drawGrid function, the coordinate min and max of the screen width and height is computed. Using the 4 numbers,
        the program is able to create the axis line. Where the x-axis line extends from 0 to the width of the canvas and the y-axis line
        extends from 0 to the height of the canvas. The min and max values are effected by the zoom and translation factors. In fact, 
        if you are to recompile the project with the glOrtho2D scaled to double what the code states, you will end up seeing the 
        grid axis move and zoom with the user. The reason the lines are not drawn on the screen when the user pans or zooms past the grid
        lines is that for both the x and y axis lines, neither take the other into account. For example, when the x line is drawn, the y value
        is zero and when the y-axis line is drawn, the x value is zero.
        
        Drawing the grid markings is not as straight forward. First, we check to see if the user has zoomed out toom much. If this is the 
        case, then the grid will be too dense for us to really see anything so don't bother to draw the grid. Next, we create the grid markings
        for the y-axis by calculating the number of times we need to loop through the code. For every 4th iteration, we need to draw the line 
        more bold in order to desginate this as a minor axis line. The program repeats this operation for the x-axis.

        First, the program finds the modulus of the coordinate / gridStep.
        What this tells the program is the "distance" from the lower grid makeing to the point.
        If the point is beyond the halfway "mark" of two grid markings, the modulus will return a number 
        greater then gridStep / 2. If the point is below the halfway "mark",
        the program will simply take the point coordinate and subtract out the modulus.
        And this is the rounded answer.
        If the point is beyond the halfway "mark", the program will add the gridstep to the 
        point and then subtract out the modulus.
        For example, if a point is at 0.40 and the grid step size is 0.25, then the point 
        is between 0.25 and 0.5. The modulus of 0.40 % 0.25 will be 0.15. Since this is 
        greater then 0.25 / 2 = 0.125 (the halfway mark), we need to add 0.25 to 0.40 (0.25 + 0.4 = 0.65)

        This function handles the resize event for the canvas.
        For more documentation regarding the wxSizeEvent class, refer to the following documentation:
        http://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.1.0/classwx_size_event.html

    /*!
        This function will query the GetWheelRotation from the event variable. This will determine if the mouse wheel moved counter-clock-wise or
        clock-wise. Depending on the status of getMouseZoomReverseState, a counter-clockwise motion will cause the canvas to zoom in and a clockwise rotation
        will cause the canvas to zoom out. If getMouseZoomReverseState is true, then the operation is reversed. The program changes the zoom variables (_zoomX and _zoomY)
        by a factor that is computed by 1.2^(GetWheelRotation/150). This value is multuplied by the current zoom factor (for x and y). The program will ensure that
        both zoom factors are equal to each other. If a user zoom windowed to a particular location, when the user zooms in or out of that location, the program 
        will reset the zoom factors back to equal to each other. The program will also calculate a small offset and add/subtract this from the _cameraX and _cameraY
        variables. This allows the program to pan towards/away from the current mouse position as the program is zooming in/out.

    /*!
        This is executed every time the user moves the mouse pointer across the canvas. THe program will check a series of status flags 
        and execute accordingly. The first flag that it checks is to see if the middel mouse button (the wheel button) is pressed down.
        This indicates that tehe user woudl like to pan across the canvas. Based on the change of pixels from the last event to the next,
        the program will calculate the shift for the _cameraX and _cameraY variables. The variables, _mousePixelX and _mousePixelY, store the
        last position of the mouse (in pixel units). The current position X and Y mouse pixels can be obtained from the function GetX() and GetY() located
        in the wxMouseEvent class. 
        If the middle mouse button is not pressed, the program will check to see if the left mouse button is pressed at the time that the mouse moved
        If so, the program will check if the canvas is to move a draggingNode/label or to update the position of the _endPoint becuase the user
        is drawing a mirror line or a selection window. 
        If the left mouse button is not pressed and the user has the right mouse button down when moving the mouse, the program will update the
        value of _endPoint variable. This occurs only if the program is in the mode to draw a selection window.

    //! Function that is executed everytime the user presses down on the left mouse button
    /*!
        This function is performing a number of different options. The primary function of this function
        is to add the geometry to the list. It does by checking the status _createNodes and _createLines and the position.
        This function will also initilize the _startPoint when in zoom window mode or when creating a mirror line
        When a down click occurs, the function will check if the booleans _doZoomWindow and _doMirrorLine are set to false.
        The function will check if the user wants to create nodes by checking if _createNodes is set to true.
        If so, the function will then scan through the entire node list and check if the mouse pointer is within the clickable area of the node.
        If so, the program will then save this node iterator. The saving function will return true if there are 2 iterators that
        have been saved. If the return is true, the program will check the boolean _createLines. If _createLines is true, the program
        will create a line between the two saved points. If false, the program will create an arc between the two points. The arc creation occurs
        later in the code becuase the code is designed to refresh the canvas such that both selected nodes are colored selected for the user's sake.
      
        If the user did not click on an area containing a node, then the program will add in a dragging node. This dragging node overrides 
        all checks for a node and is simply used as a display to show the user where they are dragging the node to. The actual node is created 
        in the function omMouseLeftUp.
      
        If _createNodes is false, this means that the user would like to create a dragging block label. Which the program will perform.

        if so, the function will check if the user wants to create nodes or block labels by checking if _createNodes is true.
        If true, the function will delete the dragging node and add in the node with all of the checking (checking for intersections). The fucntion will also round the

        If the user is creating block labels, then the function will do the same thing as the node except with block labels.

        This function completes the geometry selection process. First, the function will check if the current mouse position 
        is equal to the mouse position when the user started the process. If so, this could mean that the user selected an individual geometry
        shape. The function will then perform a series of checks to determine which geometry shape the user could have selected. This is 
        based on the distance between the geometry shape and the mouse pointer. If the user did click on a geometry shape, then the
        function will loop through all the other geometry lists and de-select any shapes that are not already selected (this only
        applies to the shapes that are different then the one selected). If the user clicked on a whitespace, then the function will
        de-select all geomerty shapes.
      
        If the variable _endPoint is greater then _startPoint on the y-plane but less then _startPoint on the x-plane, then 
        this would indicate that the user wants to select only nodes/block labels. This is determined by the variable _createNodes. If 
        true, then the user will select all ndoes within the box the user drew. If false, then the user will select the block labels.
        The program will always select a new group of nodes/labels. If the user would like to select an addiditonal set of nodes/labels,
        then the CTRL button must be pressed down. This logic applies to the lines/arcs. This function keeps a static count of all of the 
        selected geometry. This may be removed one day.
      
        To select a grouping of lines/arcs, the _endpoint variable must be less then _startPoint on the x and y-plane. The same
        logic applies for as above for the node/labels except the function will be looking at _createLines. However, in order to select a line/acr, 
        only one of the endpoints needs to be in the selection box.
      
        In order to select all of the geometry, the _endpoint must be greater then _startPoint on the x-plane. The y-plane is not looked at.
        In this mode, all of the geometry wll be selected and operated on. This would be mixed geometry mode. Again, the same logic as the
        nodes/labels applied to the mixed geometry where the user needs to have CTRL down in order to add to the curretn selection. In this mode,
        in order for a line/arc to be selected, both nodes need to be in the selection window.

        This function takes into account the 3 different cases of a mirror. On the canvas, the user draws a mirror line.
        The 3 cases this mirror line can have are vertical, horizontal, and diagonal. For each geometry shape, these 3 cases
        must be taken into account. The program will first calculate the slope of the mirror line. The slope will determine
        which of the three cases the user created.
      
        Mirroring nodes and labels are relatively simple. First, the program will calculate the y-intercept of the mirror line.
        Next, the program will calculate the perpendicular slope of the mirrored point. Then the program will calculate the 
        y-intercept of the of the line that the mirrored point is on. Lastly, the progam will caluclate the point where the 
        two lines cross and from there, we can calculate the distance between the node and the intersection. By knowing
        this distance, the mirrored point will have the same distance.
      
        For lines and arcs, the calculation is a little more invovled. The process described above is applied to both end points
        of the line/arc.However, the program will automatically select the two mirrored points in order to draw a line between
        them. IF the node already exists, then the program will scan through the entire node list and select the existing node.
